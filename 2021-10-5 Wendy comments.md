> As the more accepted terms for ethnicity are white and black but some of the self reproted ethncity forms were Cauacasian and African American then perhaps say White/Caucasian, East Asian, and Black/African American

I think it really depends on who you ask. Isn't ethnicity a personally-defined classification? Or at least, doesn't it vary a good amount between locations (i.e. USA vs Canada)? 

I can speak for these data, I saw from our canadian datasets (Van/toronto Cox), we used "Caucasian", "African", "East Asian", "South Asian" and "Asian". Whereas for the USA cohorts (n=3), they additionally sometimes included "white" and "Black" as racial terms.

The biological distinction between Caucasian and White, or between Black and African, is unclear to me, if there are any. The problem being raised is whether these groups should be "Caucasian" or "White", and "African" or "Black". I'm not sure I believe that "Black" and "White" or more racially accepted. Even if they are, I don't know if I want to contribute to the establishment of these terms. 

I think the simplest thing to do is to replace with "Caucasian/White", "African American / Black", and "Asian, East Asian, and South Asian". This more accurately represents how I processed the data.

Another suggestion is to define at the beginning and mention reasoning for consistency.

> Overall the intro is on the brief side...which is better than too long, tho maybe could think if somethings lacking...I think maybe add a paragraph about the function of the placenta.  I think you could also add more on the Ilumina array itself since you use this in all your analyses? How it works and the difference between 450K and EPIC.You know alot about it and the data processing....
