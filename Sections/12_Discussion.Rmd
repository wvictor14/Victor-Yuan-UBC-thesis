## Summary and significance of findings

<!-- In this dissertation I investigated... -->

In this dissertation, I investigated some of the major sources of variation of placental DNAm: genetics and human populations, cell type DNAm, and the presence of maternal cells in placental tissues.
Regarding these, I discovered the following insights.
Ethnicity and genetic ancestry can be accurately predicted from placental DNAm microarray data, using both DNAm markers and SNPs.
Many placental-specific DNAm features, such as PMDs, placental-specific imprinting, and repetitive element DNAm, can be found in trophoblast populations, and are often not present in the other constituent placental cell types.
Lastly, I found that maternal contamination can occur in placental samples and can be bioinformatically identified from previous placental DNAm studies.

The ethnicity predictor trained on 450k placental DNAm data builds on previous studies and adds a placental-specific approach to the toolbox of methods for accounting for population stratification and genetic ancestry in EWAS [@barfield2014; @rahmani2017; @zhou2017]. Although my placental ethnicity predictor, planet, was trained on self-reported ethnicity, I found that the resulting modelled DNAm patterns are highly genotype-dependent, and that my ethnicity predictor is highly correlated with genetic ancestry. In the placental data that I compared planet to other approaches of inferring genetic ancestry and ethnicity, I found that my tissue-specific approach performed better. This affirms this study's original hypothesis, which was that because DNAm is highly tissue-specific, and that genotype-DNAm relationships can also be highly tissue-specific [@delahaye2018], methods to infer biological variables such as ethnicity and genetic ancestry from DNAm are likely also to be tissue-specific.

Self-reported ethnicity has several shortcomings that my DNAm-based ethnicity predictor addresses.
Self-reported ethnicity is often reported for the parents for placental studies, and is often missing from the paternal information.
Self-reported ethnicity is also variably defined between countries, institutions, and individuals.
In research of biological data such as DNAm, self-reported ethnicity is included as a often inadequate [@mersha2015] surrogate of genetic ancestry, which should be accounted for in any population-based study such as the common EWAS design.
Ethnicity, or genetic ancestry, defined based on DNAm or genotyping data, which are reproducible and measurable, addresses these shortcomings of self-reported ethnicity.
It is unclear if DNAm-based genetic ancestry and ethnicity is more appropriate to use in EWAS compared to using genetic ancestry based on genotyping information, but in the absence of genotyping data, I demonstrate that DNAm-based genetic ancestry and ethnicity is a highly useful alternative to self-reported ethnicity.
