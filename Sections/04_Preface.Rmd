**Chapter 2**

Yuan, V., Price, E.M., Del Gobbo, G. et al. Accurate ethnicity prediction from placental DNA methylation data. Epigenetics & Chromatin 12, 51 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-019-0296-3

The data, text, figures, and tables published in this article are included in Chapter 2. Placental DNA methylation array data was downloaded from GEO, an open-access data repository. Project and experimental design was done by Dr. Magda Price, Dr. Giulia Del Gobbo, and professor Wendy Robinson. I conducted data quality control and preprocessing, performed statistical analysis on ethnicity and DNA methylation, trained machine learning models on the data, and wrote the manuscript. Professor Sara Mostafavi provided feedback on statistical analyses. Professor Brian Cox, Dr. Alexandra M. Binder, professor Karin B. Michels, and professor Carmen Marsit provided additional placental data, and helped write the manuscript. All authors participated in manuscript revisions.

**Chapter 3**

Yuan, V., Hui, D., Yin, Y. et al. Cell-specific characterization of the placental methylome. BMC Genomics 22, 6 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07186-6

The data, text, figures, and tables published in this article are included in Chapter 3. Placental samples were ascertained through the Robinson and Beristain labs. Professor Wendy Robinson, professor Alex Beristain, Dr. Maria Penaherrera design the project. I performed analysis of the data and wrote the manuscript. Desmond Hui helped refine the cell-sorting protocol and collected samples, with help of Dr. Maria Penaherrera and professor Alex Beristain. Yifan Yin and I created the interactive data exploration app. All authors helped revise the final manuscript.
