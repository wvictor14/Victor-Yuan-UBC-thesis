## Placental structure and development

## DNA methylation and the placenta

In the early blastocyst, the majority of gamete-derived epigenetic marks have been erased [23] (except for a small subset of largely oocyte-derived marks discussed relative to imprint-ing below) (Fig. 13.1). The trophectoderm will develop into one of the layers of the chorion aswell as the villous trophoblast, which retains this low methylated state. Hypomethylation ofchorionic villi as a whole reflects that trophoblast is the predominant cell type within this tis-sue [24]. In the mouse, trophoblast hypomethylation is associated with down-regulation ofthe DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt1a[25]. However, the role ofDNMTs in human trophoblast is less clear[26]. In contrast, the inner cell mass undergoes de novo global DNAm. These cells are the origin of the fetal tissues, but also contribute toprimitive endoderm, from which placental endothelial cells are derived, and to the extraem-bryonic mesoderm, from which villus stroma is derived. In addition to differences in DNAm,the early trophectoderm shows higher H3K27 methylation as well as lower levels of histoneH2A and/or H4 phosphorylation[27]. Further differentiation processes in both trophoblastand other lineages are associated with additional DNAm changes and histone modificationsat specific regulatory loci[28].

The tree-like structures of chorionic villi that compose the placenta consist of an outer layerof stem-like cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), which fuse together to form syncytial trophoblast (STB).This syncytium facilitates maternal-fetal exchange and produce hormones to support preg-nancy, such as progesterone, leptin, human chorionic gonadotropin, and human placentallactogen. Transcriptional and epigenetic events control cytotrophoblast differentiation andare triggered by pregnancy-associated levels in oxygen content[29, 30]. Under low oxygenconditions,  CTB  fusion  is  impaired,  and  certain  STB-specific  CpG  sites  becomehypermethylated[31]. For example, syncytin-1, which is critical for STB formation, isdownregulated in response to hypoxia through DNMT3A-dependent hypermethylation[32]. Histone deacetylase complexes (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferases (HAT) are alsoinvolved through their effects on the transcription factor GCMa, which regulates syncytin-1expression[33].

The terminally differentiated syncytium contains nuclei derived from the fusion of CTBs atvarious stages in gestation. As a result, nuclei in the syncytium are heterogeneous in their ageand structure. Nuclei from recently fused CTBs tend to contain a transcriptionally activeeuchromatic structure whereas older heterochromatic nuclei form condensed structurescalled syncytial knots[34]. The majority of STB nuclei are transcriptionally active with themajority of the nuclei lacking repressive epigenetic marks, such as DNAm, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3[35]. However, there is also an enrichment of H4K20me3, a repressive chromatinmark, that is suggested to potentially originate from the older nuclei.

CTBs can also differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which exhibit strikinglydifferent transcriptional, epigenetic, and morphological characteristics compared to STBs.During this process, expression of cell adhesion molecules and polarity are lost and expres-sion of mesenchymal markers, migratory, and invasive properties are gained[36]. Similar tocancer cells, EVTs down-regulate E-cadherin by DNA methylation and up-regulate manyproteases (e.g.,MMP9), phosphatidylinositol 30-kinase (PI3K), and several autocrine or para-crine loops (e.g., involvingEGFandVEGF) [37] as they transition into a highly invasive phe-notype. Disruption of DNAm byDNMTinhibitor 5-aza-dC results in loss of invasive andmigratory properties in EVT cells; up-regulation of epithelial markers, such as E-Cadherin,beta-Catenin, and Cadherin18; and down-regulation of mesenchymal genes, such asVIMandCDH2[38]. Transcription factors essential to the initiation of this transition process,SNAILandSLUG, are also differentially methylated between CTBs and EVTs [39].

Histone acetylation is also essential for trophoblast differentiation, and is thought to be con-trolled by placental-utero oxygen content through the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1(HIF-1) and HDACs[30]  . The HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin-A, results in increased histone acet-ylation and overexpression of tumor suppressor geneSERPINB5, leading to reduced EVT mo-tility and invasion[40]  . In contrast, acetylation of histones H2A and H2B by the CREB-bindingprotein (CBP) acetyltransferases inhibits the epithelial-mesenchyme transition and promotesepithelial characteristics in mouse studies[41]  . A higher-order chromatin structure mediatedby histone modifications in combination with a locus repeat structure was demonstrated toplay a role in STB-specific expression within the human growth hormone gene cluster[42]  ,illustrating that the DNA sequence itself can affect chromatin structure.

Our knowledge of cell-specific epigeneticsisconfined primarily totrophoblastic populations. However, additional placental cell populations are functionally important and may also be im-plicated in disease. Chorionic villus cultures yield the predominant growth of fibroblast cells,which havea DNAm profile that is much more similar tothe fetal membranes than to whole pla-cental villi[43]  . Placental-specific macrophages, Hofbauer cells (HBs), lie in the mesenchymalcore of the chorionic villi and in comparison to maternal and fetal macrophages, showhypermethylation of many immune response-related and classicalmacrophage-activation asso-ciated genes, possibly as a result of high expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B[44]  .

Our current understanding of pathological diseases that affect the placenta is contributedpredominantly from bulk-tissue profiling studies, which suffer from the limitation that cel-lular heterogeneity can result in the dilution of cell-specific signals and the creation of spu-rious ones. More targeted studies investigating cell-specific signatures will contribute to ourunderstanding of changes associated with normal placental functioning as well as ofabnormal ones.
