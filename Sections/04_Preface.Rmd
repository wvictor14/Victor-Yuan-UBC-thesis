Yuan, V., Price, E.M., Del Gobbo, G. et al. Accurate ethnicity prediction from placental DNA methylation data. Epigenetics & Chromatin 12, 51 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-019-0296-3

The data, text, figures, and tables published in this article are included in Chapter 2. Placental DNA methylation array data was downloaded from GEO, an open-access data repository. Project and experimental design was done by Dr. Magda Price, Dr. Giulia Del Gobbo, and professor Wendy Robinson. I conducted data quality control and preprocessing, performed statistical analysis on ethnicity and DNA methylation, trained machine learning models on the data, and wrote the manuscript. Professor Sara Mostafavi provided feedback on statistical analyses. Professor Brian Cox, Dr. Alexandra M. Binder, professor Karin B. Michels, and professor Carmen Marsit provided additional placental data, and helped write the manuscript. All authors participated in manuscript revisions.
