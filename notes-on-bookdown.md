# Figures

- To use special characters, and citations, use text references described in (2.2.4)[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references], and alluded to in (2.4)[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html]. See figure 1 of chapter 2 for an example.

  - Place text and text reference somewhere, then under the fig.cap option in the relevant figure chunk, insert the text reference
  
Example:

(ref:textreference) Figure title that appears in text. Figure caption that appears in text.

```{r codechunktitle, fig.cap="(ref:textreference)", eval=T, echo=T, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.extra=''}
knitr::include_graphics('path\to\image')
```

# Tables

Tables are best generated by using `kable` to print the table. That means that tables should be loaded into R as  `data.frame` objects, either through reading in a csv/xlsx/txt file, or through manual creation. 

- See (2.5)[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/tables.html] for details. Tables are referenced in the same way as figures, through the code chunk label.

- For citations within tables, create text reference outside of each cell that contains of a reference. Then insert text references as a column in the table. See chapter 2 tables 1 and 2 as examples. See kableExtra github (issues)[https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/issues/214] for discussion.
  - another option is to use `format = 'markdown'`, and then citations can be written as [@author-1999], but then all tables need to be in this format to keep style consistent across whole thesis. I have also found that this format is not as consistent and robust (e.g. text can overlap in columns with no easy fix). Footnotes also don't work with markdown format.


- Figure caption titles are by default not full-width. To make figure captions full-width, add to the YAML of man_script.Rmd:

```
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{caption}
```

and then write "\captionsetup{width=7in}" on the line before the table code chunk. See table 2.1 as an example

- To automatically wrap columns, use `kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)`

# References

I suggest using zotero. I

I liked using the built-in rstudio reference manager, which has auto-completion / search. It also adds references directly into the bib file.

# Including publications

For my dissertation, my data chapters have been published. Therefore including these published articles require some repetitive formatting and editing. Here I made a checklist of all the steps to completely incorporate these into a broader dissertation context:

-[ ] Copy and paste manuscript text
-[ ] Replace references 
  -[ ] If references are not all in zotero library, you can download a bib file from the online journal article and import that into zotero first
  -[ ] Use markdown visual editor to use the built-in citation manager
-[ ] Copy figures into their individual figure folders (images/ch#)
-[ ] Insert into main text
  -[ ] Figure itself, figure caption (see #Figures above)
-[ ] Replace in-text figure references to a linked reference
